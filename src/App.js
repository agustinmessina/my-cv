            I'm a full-stack software developer, currently working on backend in a .NET Core web api. Constantly learning 
            about new technologies and better ways to solve problems, code readability and performance are my priorities. 
            I practice Test Driven Development, read a few books and a lot of articles about it. I work well with people 
            and support my teammates whenever I can. Love to face new challenges and solve complex problems.
